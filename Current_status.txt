Completed Week 2 March 6, Connect 4 Code Along Intro + Walkthroughs
Currently doing: Week 2 March 8 Bootstrap Intro (Week 3)
+ Projects.

Between 8 & 10th it's just going over the projects and such. 

The focus now is completing the projects in order. 
1. Tamagotchi
2. Trivia Game 
3. **Spaceman - variant on “hangman”**
4. **Concentration (Memory Game)**
5. **Simon**
6. **Mastermind** (Guess the Code)
7. **Minesweeper**
8. **Blackjack**
9. **Slot Machine**
10. **Checkers**
11. **Video Poker**
12. **Solitaire**
13. **Battleship**

Each one needs to be project planned correctly as per the instructions. If can't see them elsewhere it's explained on the current video at the start. 
Also, refer back to OG project for what the readme looked like and replicate. 

I think it'll work best if we MVP Tamagotchi then move on to Trivia etc. This way we keep going over the same bits. 
Any code that I notice wll help for another (i.e deck building, shuffling) copy and paste into the appropriate projects. 
We do not move beyond the end of the weeks learning without completing these. 
Comprehensively completed the unit's work and have access and time. No excuses for not going through this. 
Try to rely on chat GPT as little as possible even for the small things. Work on being independant. Last time Owain helped,this time we're better than that.



Always push from the leading folder (weekly_work, lab_hw etc) except for the projects themselves. Keep projects seperate so they can be pushed seperately.

Currently working on: Bootstrap & Tamagotchi 

WE'll get there. I know it.
