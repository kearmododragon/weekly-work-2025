Completed Week 2 March 1. 

Cleared up the confusion.

"This" and "JS Classes" completed to my knowledge. Must double check. 

JS Classes in seperate repo as OOP_Lesson_Starter, can be pulled and checked. 

Otherwise, everything up to date and going well. 

JS Classes folder created regardless and ready to go. So either continue JS Classes or we move onto FE Activity - Styling Forms if not. 

Looking forward to doing connect 4 Code Along followed shortly by the project. Definitely redo blackjack but also do a couple others. Hang out with the projects  for a while, do code alongs to try some things and potentially even complete them all.
