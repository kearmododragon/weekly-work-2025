Completed Week 2 March 3, lab

Currently working on: connect 4 code along. Not Started
Complete the code along and then start planning the project.

Also planning for the project. Intention is going to be to do most/all of them. 
Start from the beggining and have fun with it.

Do this for every option and see how many we end up making.
- plan the design 
- set out the essentials to make it MVP and the ice box'
- code them one by one. Focus on backend first then front 

1. Tamagotchi
    - A good icebox feature (optional feature) is to allow the creatures to ‘level’ up after a certain amount of interactions / time.
    - May include interaction animations or asset changes.
2. Trivia Game

    - Use "cards" or other theme
    - Will need to display "wrong" guess until a timer expires or until the next click.
