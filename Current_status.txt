Completed Week 2 March 1. 

However, March 2 "This" has been completed and definitely looked at JS Classes at work.

Tomorrow at work, pull request to see if weekly work is up to date and if there's any overhang here. Potentially repeated a lesson but no harm in that. 

JS Classes folder created regardless and ready to go. So either continue JS Classes or we move onto FE Activity - Styling Forms if not. 

Looking forward to doing connect 4 Code Along followed shortly by the project. Definitely redo blackjack but also do a couple others. Hang out with the projects  for a while, do code alongs to try some things and potentially even complete them all.
