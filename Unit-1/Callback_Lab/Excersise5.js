// Exercise 5

function step1(cb) {
  setTimeout(function() {
    console.log('STEP 1 COMPLETE');
    cb()
  }, 750);
}

function step2(cb) {
  setTimeout(function() {
    console.log('STEP 2 COMPLETE');
    cb()
  }, 500);
}

function step3(cb) {
  setTimeout(function() {
    console.log('STEP 3 COMPLETE');
    cb()
  },250);
}
/*
The above functions are working asynchronous functions - DO NOT
change any of their code. They are what we call "black boxes"
because we do not need to know anything that goes on inside of them.

Each of the three functions accept a single argument - a callback function.

Write the code that invokes the three functions such that the output in the console will be:

STEP 1 COMPLETE
STEP 2 COMPLETE
STEP 3 COMPLETE
FINISHED

Hints: 
- Call `step1` first.
- You cannot call `step2` until after `step1` has "finished", similarly, you cannot call `step3` until `step2` has "finished".
- You must console.log the last line of the output, `FINISHED`, after `step3` has "finished".
*/

step1(function() {
  step2(function() {
    step3(function() {
      console.log('FINISHED');
    });
  });
});
