- Identify When a Function is a Callback Function
    callback function is an argument passed to another function
    The higherOrder function is responsible for calling the callback
    Design of callbacks is to allow a controlled / situation call after other proceses run (i.e. click)
    
- Use Anonymous & Named Functions as Callbacks
    -- see main.js    

- Use Callbacks with Array Iterator Methods
        -- see main.js    

- Why callbacks 
    - callbacks may be required for the function of our browser tools
    - 

- Use the  Array Iterator Method to "filter" an Array
        -- see main.js    

- Use Callbacks with Asynchronous Operations
    - synchronous - sequential -> top to bottom order it is written
        the length of time required is dependant on the code written, 2 triggers when 1 is complete
    - Asychronous all coding runs at the same time.
