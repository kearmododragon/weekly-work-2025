## DOM EVENTS
Dom events are occurences in the browser that occur automatically and can be triggered by a user. i.e. animations, screensize change etc.

### DOM EVENTS 
element.addEventListener(<event-name>, <callback>);
- **event-name** is the name of the event (string)
- **callback** is the function we want executed when the event happens. When called by the JS engine, it will be passed an *event object* as an argument.
